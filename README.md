## Introduction

This is my first project working on a real business problem in Northern California. The company has been in the plumbing business for several years but had no one to analyze their data. This project helped the business understand and use their data to increase profits.

## General Info

The main challenge of this project was dealing with many data entry issues. There were numerous misspellings, incorrect numbers, and date problems. Most of the project time was spent on cleaning this data. Afterward, I focused on creating data visualizations and collecting additional data to enhance the original information.

I gathered population data from the US Census website. This helped the business understand where most of their customers come from and identify new areas for marketing to increase their customer base and profits.

I used Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization and created a dashboard with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/PlumbingProjectUpdated/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
